* Data for the nonlinear beam
Synthetic data generated from a nonlinear FE model, resembling the European COST
Action F3 beam seen in fig [[fig:beam_setup]]. It consists of a cantilever beam
whose free end is connected to a thin beam clamped on its other side. The thin
beam can exhibit geometrically nonlinear behaviour and is mounted vertically to
limit the effect of gravity.

#+CAPTION: Experimental setup for the COST beam. Both vertical and horizontal setups were tested at University Liege(ULg). Horizontal setups avoids gravitational effects which cannot be ignored due to static deflection of the thin beam.

* NLBeam.mat
Contains M, C, K matrices for 35dof beam. The nonlinearity should be connected
to DOF 27(0 based), connected to ground. μ₁ is cubic and μ₂ quadratic. Use a
nonlinear newmark to simulate the system.

The beam is modelled as shown in fig [[fig:beam_fem]] using 14 and 3 two-
dimensional Bernoulli-Euler beam elements for the main and thin beam
respectively. The connection between the two beams is modelled by an additional
linear rotational stiffness resulting in a model with 35 dofs.

The damping is proportional damping, giving a modal damping ration of 1.27% for
the first linear mode which is high for a steel beam.

* u/y*.mat
Synthetic output and input. Generated from the matrices in NLBeam.mat with cubic
and quadratic nonlinearity on DOF 27(0-based). Only the DOFs corresponding to
the measurement locations in fig [[beam_setup]] are retained.
Thus the nonlinearities are on dof 6 and the force dof 1 for the output y.
